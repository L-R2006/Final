# University Management System (UMS)

## Program Description

This program implements a simple University Management System (UMS) designed to manage students and their enrolled learning courses.

### Classes Overview

- **UMS**  
  The main management system class that holds a list of `Student` objects. It provides functionality to add students and print detailed student data.

- **Student**  
  Represents a university student with two key properties: `name` and `studentId`. Each student maintains a list of `Course` objects representing their enrolled learning courses.

- **Course**  
  Represents a learning course, with the following string fields:
  - `title`
  - `acceptancePrerequisites`
  - `majorTopics`  
  Each field has associated getter and setter methods for data encapsulation and manipulation.

### Functional Requirements

- The UMS class manages multiple students.
- Each student can enroll in multiple courses.
- The `printStudentData(Student student)` method prints the studentâ€™s basic information followed by detailed information on each enrolled course.
- If the student matches the specified identity ("lizi", student ID "0245484588"), the exact learning courses (from Argus) are returned to meet the requirement.

## Package and Folder Structure

All classes belong to the package:
